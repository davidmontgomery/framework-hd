# TestData module

## Maintainer 

[Mateusz Uzdowski](mailto:mateusz@silverstripe.com)

## Requirements 

SilverStripe 2.4.x

## Installation 

1. Include the module folder in your project root folder and rename it to "testdata"
1. Flush the manifest (?flush=1)

## Features

- Allows easy injection of the test data via Yaml files
- Data is added *on top* of the current database 
- The test data can be updated, removed and added
- Test data can be broken down into chunks, separate Yaml files are allowed and can be added on the fly
- Original YamlFixture is overriden to allow for circular references

## Usage

You can obtain the help message by calling the following:

	sapphire/sake dev/data

You can also access the module via your browser. Log in as admin and make sure your site is in the dev mode. Then visit:

	<your_webroot>/dev/data

### Basic workflow

TestData Yaml files should be added <wwwroot>/mysite/testdata directory. The names are case insensitive and they need to have *.yml* extension. The format of these files is the same as for SapphireTest, so you can freely copy them between one and the other.

Let's start with something simple. In the data directory, create a file named *media.yml*:

	Page:
		page:
			Title: Media Releases
		release1:
			Title: Double rainbow seen over Wellington
			Parent: =>Page.page

To add this data, run:

	dev/data/load/media

Then if you'd like to add some modifications, you can edit the file:

	Page:
		page:
			Title: Media Releases
		release1:
			Title: Triple rainbow seen over Wellington
			Content: Really! Saw it with me own eyes!
			Parent: =>Page.page
		release2:
			Title: The claim about double rainbow is a hoax
			Parent: =>Page.page

To update the data, run the command again:

	dev/data/load/media

When you are done, you can remove all data by using:

	dev/data/reset

And that's basically it.

## Dev notes

1. Do not use this functionality on live.
1. The records are tracked on the basis of the Yaml filename and the Yaml handle, so you need to be aware that if you change any of these, TestData will think that you have added new records.
1. Because of the above, you can update test records as long as you retain the filename and the Yaml handle. Their IDs will be retained, so your relations will stay intact.
1. TestData will automatically publish versioned objects to Live, and remove them from both stages, so you don't have to do it manually.
1. From the project perspective, we find it useful to keep a dummy.yml with data used for dev and testing, so everyone is at least using the same baseline. Apart from that, ia.yml is useful for keeping a clean IA for initial loading to the production server and for the client.
